<h2>Wellcome to The Battle site</h2>
<p>
  The idea behind the battle site is to alow players form the <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za">Entelect R100K Challenge</a> to let there bots chalange and learn from the games.
  <br>
  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  The first step is to setup your bot yoy can find instructions on how to do this <a href="index.php?p=setup">here</a>. The reson we use a remote rig to play the games is to protect your code<br>
  and privecy the only invermation sent to the server is your moves, this way your code never leave your computer and your privacy is respected.
